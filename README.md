# Overview

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

# My process

## Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   React - JS library
-   Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned

This is my first **real** project that I have completed using React which I started learning a few days ago.

The project also provids a level of accessibility features, which I did not look into in my previous projects. I still have a long way to go in both my HTML, CSS and other skills but I think it's a start.

## Useful resources

I used the [CSS snippet developed by Josh Cameau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/react-components/visually-hidden/) to hide the elements meant for providing accessibilty.
